Description
If there is only one word, the game becomes dull. You already know the word, and thereâ€™s no challenge. In this stage, let's make the game more difficult by choosing a word from the special list with a variety of options. This way, our game gains in replayability.

Objectives
Create the following list of words: python, java, swift, javascript;
Program the game to choose a word from the list at random (you can use the random library for that). You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: computer chooses python from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You survived!
Example 2: computer chooses something other than python from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You lost!
Example 3: computer randomly chooses something other than swift from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > swift
You lost!
